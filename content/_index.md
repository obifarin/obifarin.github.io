# Olatomiwa O. Bifarin üß¨

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Georgia Tech's School of Chemistry and Biochemistry. I'm interested in AI for science, machine learning applications in metabolomics, and developing automated pipelines for cancer biomarker discovery.

Until recently, I was a PhD student in Arthur Edison's group at the University of Georgia, where I focused on metabolic phenotyping and machine learning for renal cell carcinoma detection. I have a passion for bridging AI and biochemistry to accelerate scientific discovery.
